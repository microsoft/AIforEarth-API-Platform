Images are successfully processed. The detection bounding boxes and their confidences will be returned in a json, in addition to annotated image files if `render` was true. Since multiple objects of different types may be returned, the response is encoded using `requests_toolbelt.multipart.encoder.MultipartEncoder`.

Here is an example of how you can parse the result in Python:
```
import os
import json
from requests_toolbelt.multipart import decoder
from PIL import Image

results = decoder.MultipartDecoder.from_response(r)

text_results = {}
images = {}
for part in results.parts:
    # part is a BodyPart object with b'Content-Type', and b'Content-Disposition', the later includes 'name' and 'filename' info
    headers = {}
    for k, v in part.headers.items():
        headers[k.decode(part.encoding)] = v.decode(part.encoding)
    if headers.get('Content-Type', None) == 'image/jpeg':
        c = headers.get('Content-Disposition')
        image_name = c.split('name="')[1].split('"')[0]  # this is an HTTP string; you can parse it more elegantly using a library
        image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(part.content))
        
        images[image_name] = image
    
    elif headers.get('Content-Type', None) == 'application/json':
        text_result = json.loads(part.content.decode())
        
for img_name, img in sorted(images.items()):
  img.save(img_name + '.jpg')
```
`text_result` looks like this:
```
{
  'S1_D04_R6_PICT0022.JPG': [[0.011515299789607525,
   0.11399328708648682,

where the keys are the unique image identifier that you specified for each image in the request body. The value is an array containing the detections above `confidence` that were found. The array is empty if no animals/persons/vehicles are detected above the confidence threshold. Each detection is an array also, `[ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax, confidence, category]`, where the first four floats are the _relative_ coordinates of the bounding box.
