- Please send up to 8 images to be processed as files in a multipart form. 

- The keys (`image_name` in the following example) in the files dictionary should be unique identifiers of the images, as the returned result will also be keyed by these.

- Make sure to set the content media type correctly for each file, as only files of the accepted types will be processed. 

- The accepted image types are `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `application/octet-stream`. Please send jpeg images of usual camera trap images size (500KB - 4MB).

For example, in Python:
```
  import requests
  import os

  num_images_to_upload = 3
  params = {
      'confidence': 0.8,
      'render': True
  }
  
  files = {}
  num_images = 0
  for i, image_name in enumerate(sorted(os.listdir(sample_input_dir))):
      if not image_name.lower().endswith('.jpg'):
          continue
      
      if num_images >= num_images_to_upload:
          break
      else:
          num_images += 1
      
      img_path = os.path.join(sample_input_dir, image_name)
      files[image_name] = (image_name, open(img_path, 'rb'), 'image/jpeg')
      
  r = requests.post(base_url + 'detect', params=params, files=files)
```
